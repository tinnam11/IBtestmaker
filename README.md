# IBtestmaker
This is the first big GUI project that I have created on Python with the use of MySQL for the database. 
The program is a test creator especially for the IB where the database contains test archives which users could select from.
Users are also able to create their own questions or even alternate questions within the program. Moreover, they will be able to select questions to create the test and download it as a docx/pdf file and with or without the markscheme. 

Below are some photos of the program and the different features that it has.
